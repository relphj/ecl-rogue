Important facts you need to know about ECL Rogue
------------------------------------------------

Please see the file "LICENSE" for more information about the
distribution and modification policy for ECL Rogue.

Although we can think of many changes that could be made to this game,
our goal is to leave the game as close as possible to how it was
originally imagined in 1982.  (New features were to be part of a game
called "Thief" which, alas, was never finished.)  However, we know
there are still bugs in ECL Rogue (see the ECL Rogue User Manual for
more information).  So if you fix bugs or make other changes to this
game, please submit a pull request so that we can make your changes
available to a wider audience.

ECL Rogue is dedicated to the memory of Maurice Wuts.
