BUGS
----

* Should be able to "Call" a weapon?
  But it would have to be on a per-weapon basis so two otherwise
  identical weapons wouldn't both be "Called"...

* Should not be able to know that it's an Invisible Stalker or Phantom
  Stalker that's attacking (unless quaffed See-Invisible potion or ate
  fruit)
