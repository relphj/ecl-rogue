<p>This manual describes ECL ROGUE version 4, developed at the University of
Southern California by Gary Craig, Oscar Erickson, John Relph, and Jay Skeer
(remember those names), in Summer, 1982.  This manual was last updated on

<p>What follows is the (somewhat edited) text of the original Rogue User
Manual, to whose authors we are deeply grateful.  The text has been altered to
reflect implementation discrepancies and system-dependent information.</p>

<p>`Rogue' is a visual CRT based fantasy game which runs under the TOPS20
timesharing system.  `Rogue' is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.  This paper
describes how to play Rogue, and gives a few hints for those who might
otherwise get lost in the Dungeons of Doom.</p>

<p>You have just finished your years as a student at the local fighter's guild.
After much practice and sweat you have finally completed your training and are
ready to embark upon a perilous adventure.  As a test of your skills, the local
guildmasters have sent you into the Dungeons of Doom.  Your task is to return
with the Amulet of Yendor.  Your reward for the completion of this task will be
a full membership in the local guild.  In addition, you are allowed to keep all
the loot you bring back from the dungeons.  In preparation for your journey,
you are given an enchanted mace, a bow, and a quiver of arrows taken from a
dragon's hoard in the far off Dark Mountains.  You are also outfitted with
elf-crafted armor and given enough food to reach the dungeons.  You say goodbye
to family and friends for what may be the last time and head up the road.  You
set out on your way to the dungeons and after several days of uneventful
travel, you see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Dungeons of
Doom.  It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance and spend the
night sleeping under the open skies.  In the morning you gather your mace, put
on your armor, eat what is almost your last food, and enter the dungeons.  You
have just begun a game of Rogue.</p>

<p>Your goal is to grab as much treasure as you can, find the Amulet of Yendor,
and get out of the Dungeons of Doom alive.  On the screen, a map of where you
have been and what you have seen on the current dungeon level is kept.  As you
explore more of the level, it appears on the screen in front of you.  Rogue
differs from most computer fantasy games in that it is screen oriented.
Commands are all one or two keystrokes, as opposed to pseudo English sentences,
and the results of your commands are displayed graphically on the screen rather
than being explained in words.  Another major difference between Rogue and
other computer fantasy games is that once you have solved all the puzzles in a
standard fantasy game, it has lost most of its excitement and it ceases to be
fun.  Rogue, on the other hand, generates a new dungeon every time you play it
and even the authors find it an entertaining and exciting game.</p>

<div align="center">THE DISPLAY</div>

<p>In order to understand what is going on in Rogue you have to first get some
grasp of what Rogue is doing with the screen.  The Rogue screen is intended to
replace the `You can see&nbsp;...' descriptions of standard fantasy games.  The
picture below is a sample of what a Rogue screen might look like.</p>

<pre>
                -------+----
                |..........+###
                |..@....]..|
                |....B.....|
                |..........|
                ------------

Str: 16(16) Dex: 15(15) Int: 17(17)
Gold: 0 Level: 1 Xp: 1/0 Ac: 6 Hp: 12(12)
</pre>

<p>At the bottom line of the screen are a few pieces of cryptic information
describing your current status.  Here is an explanation of what these things
mean.</p>

<p>The upper of these two lines gives various statistics about your abilities.
`<code>Str:&nbsp;N(M)</code>' is your strength, which is always a positive
integer.  `N' is your current strength, `M' is your maximum strength possible.
Note that both these values can be changed through various means.  Your
strength determines how well you perform in combat.
`<code>Dex:&nbsp;N(M)</code>' is your dexterity.  This value determines how
well you avoid monster's blows, among other things.
`<code>Int:&nbsp;N(M)</code>' is your intelligence.  Intelligence is referenced
when you are, for example, trying to discover traps, reading scrolls, and
various other instances.  This line of information will not appear on the
display until after you have gained sufficient experience (see below) to know
the values.</p>

<p>The second line of information always appears and contains the
following:</p>

<dl>
<dt>`Level:'</dt>
    <dd>This number indicates how deep you have gone in the dungeon.  It starts
at one and goes up as you go deeper into the dungeon.</dd>

<dt>`Gold:'</dt>
    <dd>The number of gold pieces you have managed to find and keep with you so
far.</dd>

<dt>`Hp:'</dt>
    <dd>Your current and maximum hit points.  Hit points indicate how much
damage you can take before you die.  The more you get hit in a fight, the lower
they get.  You can regain hit points by resting.  The number in parentheses is
the maximum number your hit points can reach.</dd>

<dt>`Ac:'</dt>
    <dd>Your current armor class.  This number indicates how effective your
armor is in stopping blows from unfriendly creatures.  The lower this number
is, the more effective the armor.</dd>

<dt>`Xp:'</dt>
    <dd>These two numbers give your current experience level and experience
points.  As you do things, you gain experience points.  At certain experience
point totals, you gain an experience level.  The more experienced you are, the
better you are able to fight and to withstand magical attacks.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The top line of the screen is reserved for printing messages that describe
things that are impossible to represent visually.  If you see a
<code>--More--</code> on the top line, this means that Rogue wants to print
another message on the screen, but it wants to make certain that you have read
the one that is there first.  To read the next message, just type a space.  The
rest of the screen is the map of the level as you have explored it so far.
Each symbol on the screen represents something.  Here is a list of what the
various symbols mean:</p>

<dl>

<dt>`@'</dt>
    <dd>This symbol represents you, the adventurer.</dd>

<dt>`-',`|'</dt>
    <dd>These symbols represent the walls of rooms.</dd>

<dt>`+'</dt>
    <dd>A door to/from a room.</dd>

<dt>`.'</dt>
    <dd>The floor of a room.</dd>

<dt>`#'</dt>
    <dd>The floor of a passage between rooms.</dd>

<dt>`*'</dt>
    <dd>A pile or pot of gold.</dd>

<dt>`)'</dt>
    <dd>A weapon of some sort.</dd>

<dt>`['</dt>
    <dd>A piece of armor.</dd>

<dt>`!'</dt>
    <dd>A flask containing a magic potion.</dd>

<dt>`?'</dt>
    <dd>A piece of paper, usually a magic scroll.</dd>

<dt>`='</dt>
    <dd>A ring with magic properties.</dd>

<dt>`/'</dt>
    <dd>A magical staff or wand.</dd>

<dt>`^'</dt>
    <dd>A trap, watch out for these.</dd>

<dt>`%'</dt>
    <dd>A staircase to other levels.</dd>

<dt>`&amp;'</dt>
    <dd>A piece of food.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The alphabetic characters represent the various inhabitants of the Dungeons
of Doom.  Watch out, they can be nasty and vicious.</p>

<div align="center">GIVING COMMANDS TO ROGUE</div>

<p>Commands are given to Rogue by typing one to three characters.  The list of
commands is rather long, but it can be read at any time during the game with
the `?' command.  Here it is for reference, with a short explanation of each
command.</p>

<dl>
<dt>`?'</dt>
    <dd>The help command.  Lists all commands available.</dd>

<dt>`/'</dt>
    <dd>This is the `What is that on the screen?' command. A `/' followed by
any character that you see on the level, will tell you what that character is.
For instance, typing `/@' will tell you that the symbol `@' represents you, the
player.</dd>

<dt>`h'</dt>
    <dd>Move left.  You move one space to the left.  If you use upper case you
will continue to move left until you find something of interest.  This works
for all movement commands (e.g., `H' means run in direction `h').  Note that
you cannot attack a monster in fast movement, since you will stop without
hitting the monster in question.  See below for another method of movement
preferred by some, `keypad movement'.</dd>

<dt>`j'</dt>
    <dd>Move down.</dd>

<dt>`k'</dt>
    <dd>Move up.</dd>

<dt>`l'</dt>
    <dd>Move right.</dd>

<dt>`y'</dt>
    <dd>Move diagonally up and left.</dd>

<dt>`u'</dt>
    <dd>Move diagonally up and right.</dd>

<dt>`b'</dt>
    <dd>Move diagonally down and left.</dd>

<dt>`n'</dt>
    <dd>Move diagonally down and right.</dd>

<dt>`&nbsp;'</dt>
    <dd>Hit the space bar to do nothing but rest.  Remember that monsters get
one move for each `&nbsp;' typed, so be careful with the &lt;repeat&gt;
key.</dd>

<dt>`t'</dt>
    <dd>Throw an object.  This is a prefix command.  When followed with a
direction it throws an object in the specified direction.  (e.g., type `tph' to
throw object `p' to the left.)</dd>

<dt>`f'</dt>
    <dd>Find prefix.  Equivalent to typing a capital movement command, e.g.,
`fh' is the same as `H'.  Provided for compatiblity with older versions.</dd>

<dt>`z'</dt>
    <dd>Zap prefix.  Point a staff or wand in a given direction and fire it.
You are asked first what to zap and then the direction.  After being
identified, non-directional staffs need not be given a direction.  Some staves
always require a direction to `zap'.</dd>

<dt>`s'</dt>
    <dd>Search for traps and secret doors.  Examine each space immediately
adjacent to you for the existence of a trap or secret door.  There is a large
chance that even if there is something there, you won't find it, so you might
have to search a while before you find something.</dd>

<dt>`>'</dt>
    <dd>Climb down a staircase to the next level.  Not surprisingly, this can
only be done if you are standing on staircase.</dd>

<dt>`i'</dt>
    <dd>Inventory.  List what you are carrying in your pack.</dd>

<dt>`I'</dt>
    <dd>Single-item inventory.  Describes one specified item in your pack, or
all the items of a specified class, by typing the character that represents the
type of object you wish to inventory.</dd>

<dt>`q'</dt>
    <dd>Quaff one of the potions you are carrying.</dd>

<dt>`r'</dt>
    <dd>Read one of the scrolls in your pack.</dd>

<dt>`e'</dt>
    <dd>Eat food from your pack.</dd>

<dt>`w'</dt>
    <dd>Wield a weapon.  Take a weapon out of your pack and carry it for use in
combat, replacing the one you are currently using (if any).</dd>

<dt>`W'</dt>
    <dd>Wear armor.  You can only wear one suit of armor at a time.  This takes
extra time.</dd>

<dt>`T'</dt>
    <dd>Take armor off.  You can't remove armor that is cursed.  This also
takes extra time.</dd>

<dt>`P'</dt>
    <dd>Put on a ring.  You can wear only two rings at a time (one on each
hand).  If you aren't wearing any rings, this command will ask you which hand
you want to wear it on, otherwise, it will place it on the unused hand.  The
program assumes that you wield your sword in your right hand.</dd>

<dt>`R'</dt>
    <dd>Remove a ring.  If you are only wearing one ring, this command takes it
off.  If you are wearing two, it will ask you which one you wish to
remove.</dd>

<dt>`d'</dt>
    <dd>Drop an object.  Take something out of your pack and leave it lying on
the floor.  Only one object can occupy each space.  You cannot drop a cursed
object at all if you are wielding or wearing it.</dd>

<dt>`C'</dt>
    <dd>Call an object something.  If you have a type of object in your pack
which you wish to remember something about, you can use the call command to
give a name to that type of object.  This is usually used when you figure out
what a potion, scroll, ring, or staff is after you pick it up.  (See the option
`ask' below).</dd>

<dt>`^'</dt>
    <dd>Identify a trap in your vicinity.  This command asks for the direction
of the trap which is to be identified.</dd>

<dt>`o'</dt>
    <dd>Examine and set options.  This command is further explained in the
section on options.</dd>

<dt>`v'</dt>
    <dd>Type out the current Rogue version information.  This tells you which
version of the game you are playing, and any recent updates.</dd>

<dt>`C-L'</dt>
    <dd>Redraws the screen.  Useful if spurious messages or transmission errors
have messed up the display.  Hold down &lt;Control&gt; and type `L'.</dd>

<dt>`C-R'</dt>
    <dd>Repeat last message.  Useful when a message disappears before you can
read it.  Hold down &lt;Control&gt; and type `R'.</dd>

<dt>`C-T'</dt>
    <dd>Print current ROGUE run status.</dd>

<dt>&lt;ESC&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Cancel a command or prefix.</dd>

<dt>`Q'</dt>
    <dd>Quit.  Leave the game.</dd>

</dl>

<div align="center">KEYPAD MOVEMENT</div>

<p>The numbers on the keypad, if your terminal has one, can also be used to
move.  The direction that you want to move corresponds to the key in that
direction on the keypad from the center `5' key.  Thus, you could move upwards
by typing `8', down and right with `3', etc.  `5' is used to move in `fast
mode', as in capital letter and `f' prefix commands above.  Just type `5'
followed by the digit representing the desired direction.  Two consecutives
`5's lock fast mode on, so that all commands operate in fast mode without the
fast prefix.  Two more consecutive `5's will turn fast mode off again.  If you
attack a monster or are attacked by one fast mode will be turned off.</p>

<div align="center">MOVEMENT AND VISION IN THE DUNGEON</div>

<p>Rooms in the dungeons are either lit or dark.  If you walk into a lit room,
the entire room will be drawn on the screen as soon as you enter.  If you walk
into a dark room, it will only be displayed as you explore it.  Upon leaving a
room, all objects inside the room which might move are erased from the screen.
In the darkness you can only see one space in all directions around you.  A
corridor is always dark.</p>

<p>If you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt to run into it.
Many times a monster you find will mind its own business unless you attack it.
It is often the case that discretion is the better part of valor.</p>

<p>When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want to pick the
object up.  This is accomplished in Rogue by walking over the object.  If you
are carrying too many things, the program will tell you and it won't pick up
the object, otherwise it will add it to your pack and tell you what you just
picked up.</p>

<p>Many of the commands that operate on objects must prompt you to find out
which object you want to use.  You may type a `*' to get a list of the objects
which you could use for a particular command.  If you change your mind and
don't want to do that command after all, just type an `&lt;ESC&gt;' and the
command will be aborted.</p>

<p>Some objects, like armor and weapons, are easily differentiated.  Others,
like scrolls and potions, are given labels which vary according to type.
During a game, any two of the same kind of object with the same label are the
same type.  However, the labels will vary from game to game.  When you use one
of these labeled objects, if its effect is obvious Rogue will remember what it
is for you.  If it's effect isn't extremely obvious, you can use the `call'
command (see above) or the `ask' option (see below) to scribble down something
about it so you will recognize it later.  Some weapons, like arrows, come in
bunches, but most come one at a time.  In order to use a weapon, you must wield
it.  To fire an arrow out of a bow, you must first wield the bow, then throw
the arrow.  You can only wield one weapon at a time, but you can't change
weapons if the one you are currently wielding is cursed.</p>

<div align="center">OBJECTS IN THE DUNGEON</div>

<p>There are various sorts of armor lying around in the dungeon.  Some of it is
enchanted, some is cursed, and most is just normal.  Different armor types have
different armor classes.  The lower the armor class, the more protection the
armor affords against the blows of monsters.  Here is a list of the various
armor types and their normal armor class:</p>

<pre>

	  Type                          Class =

	  None                            10
	  Leather armor                    8
	  Studded leather / Ring mail      7
	  Scale mail                       6
	  Chain mail                       5
	  Banded mail / Splint mail        4
	  Plate mail                       3
</pre>

<p>If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor class will be lower than
normal.</p>

<p>If a suit of armor is cursed, its armor class will be higher, and you will
not be able to remove it.  However, not all armor with a class that is higher
than normal is cursed.  Scrolls come with titles in an unknown tongue.  After
you read a scroll, it disappears from your pack.  Potions are labeled by the
color of the liquid inside the flask.  They disappear after being quaffed.
Staves and wands do the same kinds of things.  Staves are identified by a type
of wood; wands by a type of metal or bone.  They are generally things you want
to do to something over a long distance so you must point them at what you wish
to affect to use them.  Some staves are not affected by the direction they are
pointed, though.  Staves come with multiple magic charges, the number being
random, and when they are used up, the staff is just a piece of wood or metal.
Rings are very useful items, since they are relatively permanent magic, unlike
the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and staves.  Of course, the
bad rings are also more powerful.  Most rings also cause you to use up food
more rapidly, the rate varying with the type of ring.  Rings are differentiated
by their stone settings.</p>

<div align="center">SETTING YOUR OPTIONS</div>

<p>Due to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of the way Rogue should
do things, there are a set of options you can set that cause Rogue to behave in
various different ways.</p>

<p>When you type `o' in Rogue, it clears the screen and displays the current
settings for all the options.  It then places the cursor by the value of the
first option and waits for you to type.  You can type `&lt;Enter&gt;' or
'&lt;Return&gt;', which means to go to the next option, an `&lt;ESC&gt;' which
means to return to the game, or you can give the option a value.  For boolean
options this merely involves typing `t' for true or `f' for false.  For string
options, type the new value followed by '&lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt;.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the options and an explanation of what each one is for.
The default value for each is enclosed in square brackets.  For character
string options, input over thirty characters will be ignored.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Terse [false]</dt>
    <dd>Useful for those who are tired of the sometimes lengthy messages of
Rogue.</dd>

<dt>Jump [false]</dt>
    <dd>If this option is set, running moves will not be displayed until you
reach the end of the move.  This saves considerable CPU and display time.  You
should set this option `true' if you are running over a slow dialup connection
or are being charged for CPU usage!</dd>

<dt>Flush [true]</dt>
    <dd>All typeahead is thrown away after each round of battle.  This is
useful for those who type far ahead and then watch in dismay as a Kobold kills
them.</dd>

<dt>Slow [false]</dt>
    <dd>Do inventories one item at a time.  Useful for really slow dialups,
because the echo area is used, rather that the entire screen.</dd>

<dt>Ask [true]</dt>
    <dd>Upon reading a scroll or quaffing a potion which does not automatically
identify itself upon use, Rogue will ask you what to name it so you can
recognize it if you encounter it again.</dd>

<dt>Turn [true]</dt>
    <dd>Turn corners in hallways when in `fast' movement.  That is, you can run
all the way through a hallway, even if the hall bends.  You will stop if you
meet a monster or if the hall forks or dead-ends.</dd>

<dt>Tomb [true]</dt>
    <dd>Display a tombstone upon the death of your character.</dd>

<dt>Name [&lt;username&gt;]</dt>
    <dd>This is the name of your character.  It is used if you get on the top
ten scorer's list.  Only the first 25 characters of the names will be shown on
this list, though.  The default value is your login username.  You cannot
choose a valid username other than your own.</dd>

<dt>Fruit [slime-mold]</dt>
    <dd>This should hold the name of a fruit (or any food) that you enjoy
eating.  It is basically a whimsey that the program uses in a couple of
places.</dd>

</dl>

<p>There is a way to get Rogue to give you the same name and option settings
each game, without you having to set them yourself.  What you do is create a
file in your directory called `<code>.rogue.init</code>'.  In this file you can
put what you want your defaults to be.  Rogue always looks in your
<b>connected</b> directory for this file. To set your name, put a line in the
file like:</p>

<pre>
	name The Rogue King
</pre>

<p>To set the fruit name, do this:</p>

<pre>
	fruit Watermelon
</pre>

<p>To set a option (make it true) put its name in the file, each on a separate
line: The seven options are named 'terse', 'flush', 'slow', 'turn', 'jump',
'ask', and 'tomb'.  To make a option false, either omit its name or precede it
with 'no'.  Also, this requires that you be sure to put a carriage return at
the end of each line, <b>especially</b> the last (many people often forget
this).</p>

<div align="center">SCORING</div>

<p>If you quit the game, you get out with all of your gold intact.  If,
however, you get killed in the Dungeons of Doom, your body is forwarded to your
next-of-kin, along with 95% of your gold; five percent of your gold is kept by
the Dungeons' wizard as a fee.  This should make you consider whether you want
to take one last hit at that monster and possibly live, or quit and thus stop
with whatever you have.  If you quit, you do get all your gold, but if you
swing and live, you might find more.</p>

<p>A `Personal' top ten scores list is maintained.  A human-readable file
called `<code>.rogue.scores</code>' is written in the player's
connected directory.  This file is for the player's use only, and may be
altered in any way.  However, if Rogue cannot interpret the contents of the
file, the questionable lines are removed.  Thus, it is to your advantage to not
alter the file.  Rogue automatically updates the file if you complete a game
which is one of your personal best with your score, character name, date, and
disposition of the game.</p>

<div align="center">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</div>

<p>Rogue was originally conceived of by Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy.  Ken
Arnold and Michael Toy then smoothed out the user interface, and added jillions
of new features.  We would like to thank Bob Arnold, Michelle Busch, Andy
Hatcher, Kipp Hickman, Mark Horton, Daniel Jensen, Bill Joy, Joe Kalash, Steve
Maurer, Marty McNary, Jan Miller, and Scott Nelson for their ideas and
assistance, and also the teeming multitudes who graciously ignored work,
school, and social life to play Rogue and send us bugs, complaints, suggestions
and just plain flames.  And also Mom.</p>

<div align="center">[End of original (though quite altered) document]</div>

<div align="center">WINNING THE GAME</div>

<p>You must get out of the Dungeons of Doom alive, with the Amulet of Yendor,
to win the game.  However, the Amulet is not something carelessly cast aside by
some unthinking monster.  It is guarded by the fearsome Demon Lord Juiblex,
whom you must attack to gain the Amulet.  Only then may you find your way to
the surface.</p>

<div align="center">BUGS</div>

<p>The number of misfeatures, or outright bugs, in Rogue is still rather large.
The authors would appreciate a mailed report of all bugs encountered.  Messages
should be sent to &lt;bug-rogue@idiot-dog.com&gt;.  Please note that many
things you might think to be bugs are really features.  Of course, something
like an illegal instruction interrupt or illegal memory reads/writes are
definitely bugs, as are infinite loops.  The program also produces its own
error messages; these are also legitimate bugs.  The text of any of these
messages and the last command typed should be included in the bug report.
Additionally, Rogue creates a file called <code>.rogue.log</code> in your
connected directory; please include the text of that file in the bug report.
Messages such as `Rogue blew up' don't help.  All reports will be dealt with
swiftly.</p>

<p>Now it is time for the local Rogue authors (Rogue Lords?) to make their
acknowledgements.  Thanks are due to Maurice Wuts, Bob Schwartzkopf, and Mark
Brown for their ideas and assistance, and of course to all the above mentioned
people without whom the game undoubtedly wouldn't exist.</p>
